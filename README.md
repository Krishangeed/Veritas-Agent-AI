# 🧠 Veritas Agent — Deepfake Detection Assistant

Veritas Agent is an AI-powered forensic system that helps users verify the authenticity of videos. It provides a credibility score and natural-language explanations rather than just returning “real” or “fake.”
“Veritas” means truth — and this system exists to verify it. 🔍✨

### Why It Matters

Deepfakes are becoming more accessible and harder to detect. Existing tools are often technical, inaccessible, or provide no reasoning. Veritas Agent bridges the gap with a user-friendly forensic assistant.

---

### How It Works

1. User uploads or selects a demo video  
2. Frames and faces are extracted  
3. Deepfake models (MesoNet/XceptionNet) run classification  
4. An AI assistant explains results in a readable format
